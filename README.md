# Dynamic indicators

**Dynamic indicators** is a script that will allow any car that has been fitted with it (by the vehicle developer), to have dynamic indicators. This will allow cars to have any of the following features:
- Hide DRL when the indicator is on;
- Hide Taillights and/or brakelights while the indicator is on;
- Replace the stock GTA indicator sequence with a custom sequence, including the Audi "swoosh" and the Mustang sequential - anything really!
